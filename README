design.book is a mobile application for designers and design enthusiasts to document, organize, and share their design journeys with each other. By giving designers a quick way to curate their process, the app helps them visualize and communicate their process in different ways.

Our motivation around creating design book is to allow design enthusiasts to peer into the process and techniques of other designers and learn from each others experiences. 

The application guides a user or a team as they follow a design process, allowing them to visually capture details about different design activities such as brainstorming, mind-maps, user scenarios, interview etc. Since the app captures the various stages and activities of the design process, users can share their experiences of designing products and services with others.
